# SPACE BATTLE RULEBOOK V0.1

[Game Phases](#game-phases-1)

## Introduction
**V0.0:** I’ve been interested in making a video game for a while. The thought process that eventually led to this one is far too long to be written in this small introduction, and I suspect that it isn’t terribly interesting to most readers. In any case, if you are interested in learning more about this game, or if you have any comments or questions, you can reach me at bsuh42@gmail.com. This is probably the best way to get in touch with me and probably the method which is most likely to elicit a response. Anyways, I should probably describe what this game is all about.
This is a game designed to simulate a space battle between two opposing fleets. Sometime in the far future, humanity has colonized much of the galaxy and of course, they brought many of their prejudices and grievances with them (well, in the lore I have planned, most of the casus belli would be new-found grievances). This of course led to combat, some of it involving spacefaring vessels. Part of the goal of this game is to teach me how to use Python, and so many of the mechanics will be fairly basic. I don’t imagine that I will revolutionize the turn-based strategy genre with this, and I am not aiming to do so. In any case, I hope that you enjoy this little game.
N.B. I will be leaving comments as I write this rulebook. I will try to be consistent with the method by which I leave these comments, and let’s say I will be leaving them in italics, sort of like this.
**V0.1:** I don’t know if I’ll copy each introduction over between each iteration of the rulebook. Probably not because it’ll start to get pretty long. Anyways, what’s changed between this and version 0.0? I’m going to try my hand at formatting and making sure everything sounds uniform. The base rules will likely remain the same as v0.0 unless I find some mistakes or think of a better version of the rules. In any case, let’s get started with v0.1. You’ve probably already noticed the cover page and the table of contents. Those are the sorts of changes I meant when I said I was going to update the formatting.
